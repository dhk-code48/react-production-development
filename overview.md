> **Note:** This blog post assume that you have at least the basic knowledge of building website using React.js

React is an javascript library for building modern front-end applications. It ha a huge ecosystem with thousands of great libraries for literally any thing you might need. React application can be in any way you like, but this type of flexibility comes with a cost. Since their is no pre-defined way or architecture that developer can follow it often lead to a messy, inconsistent, and complicated codebase.

The goal here is to provide a collection of best practices and the best tools to implement while building React application.

## What makes a React application "bulletproof"?

This blog doesn't aim to be the one for all React applications as there are many different use cases, but it tries to provide a solid foundation for building applications based on the following principles:

- Easy to get started with
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Uses the right tools for the job
- Clean boundaries between different parts of the application
- Everyone on the team is on the same page when it comes to how things are done
- Secure, Performant and consistent
- Scalable in terms of codebase and team size
- Issues detectable as early as possible
