React is an excellent tool for building front-end applications. It has a diverse ecosystem with hundreds of great libraries for literally anything you might need. However, being forced to make so many choices can be overwhelming. It is also very flexible, you can write React applications in any way you like, but that flexibility comes with a cost. Since there is no pre-defined architecture that developers can follow, it often leads to a messy, inconsistent, and over-complicated codebase.
This repo doesn't aim to be a silver bullet for all React applications as there are many different use cases, but it tries to provide a solid foundation for building applications based on the following principles:

- Easy to get started with
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Uses the right tools for the job
- Clean boundaries between different parts of the application
- Everyone on the team is on the same page when it comes to how things are done
- Performant
- Scalable in terms of codebase and team size
- Issues detectable as early as possible
